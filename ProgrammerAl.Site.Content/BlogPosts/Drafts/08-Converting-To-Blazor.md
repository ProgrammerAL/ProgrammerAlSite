### Receiving the Quest
*The spells you've been working on in recent times have all worked well enough. You test them and eventually put your full trust behind them. But you have this feeling in the back of your head that makes you think there's more you can do to trust what the spell is doing. Or, it's another spider bite.*

*You roll a d20 and suddenly realize what you've been missing. A good way to look at your custom spells and get a sense of how well they're crafted. No longer should you only rely on automating the testing of the spell itself. From now on you will analyze how the magical energies come together to ensure you can always update them.*

### What is Blazor?

[Web Assembly](https://webassembly.org/), aka WASM, is the W3C STANDARD for allowing the web browser to run compiled code, in addition to JavaScript. Blazor is the implementation from Microsoft for running .NET code through WASM.

Even though Blazor is relatively new and still in preview (only version 0.7 as of this writing), there are already tons of example/tutorials/outlines online for learning to use it. The official website, [Blazor.net](https://blazor.net/), is a great starting point AND the resource I used the most when starting my first project with it. Because of this, I won't go over it too much of the technical details.

### Gotchas

### Summary

After playing around with SonarCloud a bit, I wish I could use it on every project I work on. The charts are pretty and it gives you a nice sense of how things are going for a project. Give it a try. Come one. All the cool kids are doing it. At least, that's what I'm told.

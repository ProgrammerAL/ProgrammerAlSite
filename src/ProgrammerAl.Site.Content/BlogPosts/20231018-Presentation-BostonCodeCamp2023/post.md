# Slide Decks and Demo Code

If you'd like to see the demo code, and presentation slides, they are hosted on GitHub <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ProgrammerAL/Presentations-2023/tree/main/boston-code-camp-35">here</a>.

# The Presentations

I gave 2 talks at Boston Code Camp 2023 (detailed below). Both on Pulumi, but for different experience levels. The conference page is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bostoncodecamp.com/CC35/Schedule/SessionGrid">here</a>.

## A Beginner's Guide to Pulumi

Pulumi is more than just, "A competitor to Terraform." It's an Infrastructure as Code tool for managing cloud infrastructure through general purpose coding languages like C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, and others. In this introductory session we'll review the basic features of Pulumi and review some code demos that show how easy it is to get started creating new cloud infrastructure. By then end of the session, we'll have enough of an understanding to get started using Pulumi to manage cloud infrastructure for any new projects.

## Practical Pulumi

In this session we'll look at patterns that emerge while using Pulumi to manage your cloud infrastructure. This is an intermediate session assuming you know the basics of Pulumi, but haven't used it for a full project yet. We will use C# and Azure in demos, but the concepts work with every programming language and cloud supported by Pulumi.

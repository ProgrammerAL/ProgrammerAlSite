## ONETUG September 2025

The Orlando .NET Developers Group (aka ONETUG) invited me to speak in their September 2025 meetup about Nullable Reference Types in C#: https://www.meetup.com/onetug/events/310624118

## Acount null! in C#

__Session Abstract__: 
Null references are a problem that can show up anywhere. As developers, we have to litter out code with null checks. Thankfully C# has a feature to help with that, Nullable Reference Types (NRTs). They utilize a mix of syntax and special C# Attributes to enable null checking at compile time. It's not a perfect system, but it's WAY better than not using NRTs.

In this session we'll review (and demo!) the different ways Nullable Reference Types help us when something may be null, by talking about:
- The helpful NRT C# syntax and attributes
- How NRT code is different for object deserialization
- Cases where NRTs aren't as helpful as we'd like them to be

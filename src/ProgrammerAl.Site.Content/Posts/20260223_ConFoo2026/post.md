## ConFoo 2026

ConFoo is a development conference held in Montreal, Canada. The 2026 event was held February 25-26. The full site info is at: https://confoo.ca/en/2026

I performed two sessions, "Setting Up Your C# Pit of Success" and "Coding C# with C#".


## Setting Up Your C# Pit of Success

__Session Abstract__: 
Did you know a C# project can detect when there's a known security vulnerability for a NuGet package it's using? Or that you can manage warnings/errors/suggestions for an entire C# project in a single file, without installing an extension?

C# has a handful of free features we can use to enforce high code quality. In this session, we'll look at those C# features and discuss what it takes to use them and create our own C# pit of success.

## Coding C# with C#

__Session Abstract__: 
Remembering every step of a coding pattern opens the door to mistakes. We're human after all (or an LLM trained on human written code). Thankfully we can write C# code that helps us write our C# code. C# Roslyn Analyzers, Roslyn Code Fixes, and even Source Generators can help us automate the code we write.

In this session we'll review those aforementioned features and discuss their pros and cons, plus the benefits of codifying code.

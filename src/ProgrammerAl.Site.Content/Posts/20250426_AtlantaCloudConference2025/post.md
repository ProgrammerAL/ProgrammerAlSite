__Session Abstract__: 
Serverless used to be all the rage, then the term became overloaded and it seems like we all stopped talking about it. But the technology is still alive and kicking. And like all technology, it has its own set of tradeoffs.

In this talk we'll define what "Serverless" is, and discuss the different ways we write serverless code from a traditional model. We'll also review the different services Azure has available for hosting hosting our applications.

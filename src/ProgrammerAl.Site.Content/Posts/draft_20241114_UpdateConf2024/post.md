## Update Conference Prague 2024

Update Conference Prague 2024 was hosted on November 14-15, 2024. https://www.updateconference.net/en/2024/schedule

I performed a session titled, "Entire Stack C#" which is an overview of how to use C# for tasks in software development that we don't usually use it for. Tasks like CI/CD pipelines, and Infrastructure as Code. I performed a demo sample of all of that in one solution.

## Entire Stack C#

__Session Abstract__: 
Full stack apps are great and all, but they're not all the code written for an application. "Full Stack" only means front-end and back-end code. As developers we write code for other scenarios where the available tooling is less than ideal. Let's take things a step further and create a Full Stack solution that uses C# for as much as possible. The backend web service, a frontend web app, CI/CD pipelines, and some Infrastructure as Code to manage creating/updating the cloud infrastructure. A couple lines of YAML, a bit of JSON, and whole lot of C# love.

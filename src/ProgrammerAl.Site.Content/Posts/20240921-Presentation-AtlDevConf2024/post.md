## Session Abstract

Writing code is only 40% of the work. Maintaining high-quality code is maybe another 20%. Reviewing PRs and updating dependencies are just some of the manual processes we have to deal with that regularly take us away from the fun part of development: writing code. But we're developers, and we can automate these processes. Nay, we MUST automate or risk becoming less efficient the longer we work on a codebase. Thankfully, the 20+ year lifespan of C# and .NET means it has some features built-in to help us enforce certain levels of code quality.

In this session, we'll look at the common pitfalls that take us away from writing code. We'll also look at different ways to automate those processes and discuss the pros and cons of those approaches. By the end, we'll have covered what you can do to set up your own pit of success for your C# projects.

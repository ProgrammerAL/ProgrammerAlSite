## Cybersecurity Layers

I like to image all security software as ogres. The firewall is an ogre, JWT validation is an ogre, network rules are an ogre with a top hat (I don't know why, it just is).

If you're unfamiliar with the reference, it's from the 2001 smash hit film, Shrek. You can read the direct quote from: https://www.quotes.net/mquote/85881.

But more importantly than that, security is like an onion because it's done in layers. If you don't believe me, do an internet search for "Security onion layers" and see how many sites pop up with that phrase. But it's repeated so much because it's true. No single security mecahnism offers 100% protection. That's why there are so many kinds of ogres.

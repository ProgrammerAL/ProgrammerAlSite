## Infrastructure as Code for Developers with Pulumi

__Session Abstract__:
Automating your cloud environment with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is complex. You have to know what your application needs to run, plus be an expert with your cloud provider of choice, and finally you need to know the toolset you're using to create that cloud infrastructure. But as developers we can use Pulumi to make this easier with tools we already use each day. In this session we'll review the basics of Pulumi to create cloud resources for your application, and see code demos that create said cloud infrastructure. By the end, you'll have enough of an understanding to get started using Pulumi for your projects.

# Atlanta Cloud Conference 2024

Atlanta Cloud Conference 2024 was hosted on March 23rd, 2024. https://atlantacloudconference.com/

I performed two sessions, "Beginner's Guide to Pulumi: Infrastructure as Code with Code" and "Azure Managed Identities: Connect Without Connection Strings"

__Session Abstract__: 

Automating your cloud environment with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is complex. You have to know what your application needs to run, plus be an expert with your cloud provider of choice, and finally you need to know the toolset you're using to create that cloud infrastructure. But as developers we can use Pulumi to make this easier with tools we already use each day. In this session we'll review the basics of Pulumi to create cloud resources for your application, and see code demos that create said cloud infrastructure. By the end, you'll have enough of an understanding to get started using Pulumi for your projects.

# Azure Managed Identities: Connect Without Connection Strings

__Session Abstract__: 
Connection strings, tokens, client secrets, and username/password combos are so easy to use. Almost too easy. But in a world where tokens get leaked on an almost daily basis, you DO NOT want to be the person who leaked it. This is where Azure Managed Identities can help you. You can't leak what you don't have. Lets spend some time learning about Managed Identities and then convert an Azure application from using connection strings to accessing everything through a Managed Identity.

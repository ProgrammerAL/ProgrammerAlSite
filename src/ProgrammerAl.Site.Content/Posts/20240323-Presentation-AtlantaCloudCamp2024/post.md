# Slide Decks and Demo Code

If you'd like to see the demo code, and presentation slides, they are hosted on GitHub <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ProgrammerAL/Presentations-2024/tree/main/atlanta-cloud-conference-2024">here</a>.

# The Presentations

I gave 2 talks at <a target="_blank" href="https://atlantacloudconference.com/">Atlanta Cloud Conference</a> (each detailed below). One on writing IaC from a developers perspective using Pulumi, and the other using Azure Managed Identities to avoid using connection strings.

## Infrastructure as Code: Getting Started with Real Code and Pulumi

Automating your cloud environment with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is complex. You have to know what your application needs to run, plus be an expert with your cloud provider of choice, and finally you need to know the toolset you're using to create that cloud infrastructure. But as developers we can use Pulumi to make this easier with tools we already use each day. In this session we'll review the basics of Pulumi to create cloud resources for your application, and see code demos that create said cloud infrastructure. By the end, you'll have enough of an understanding to get started using Pulumi for your projects.

## Azure Managed Identities: Connect Without Connection Strings

Connection strings, tokens, client secrets, and username/password combos are so easy to use. Almost too easy. But in a world where tokens get leaked on an almost daily basis, you DO NOT want to be the person who leaked it. This is where Azure Managed Identities can help you. You can't leak what you don't have. Lets spend some time learning about Managed Identities and then convert an Azure application from using connection strings to accessing everything through a Managed Identity.

## On Shifting Left

I really, really hope no one takes this as an insult. I think (no, I know!) everyone working in the software pipeline does a ton of work. But when I hear Shift Left I hear a lot of people putting work on someone else's plate. 

This isn't a complaint. Shifting Left is a good thing. We do things earlier in the process, where it's cheaper and easier to accomplish. It's a win for everyone. But with more and more tasks being shifted earlier in the pipeline, at some point it feels like we all just have more work to do.

Anyway, I do web comics now and I hope you enjoyed this inaugural one. Let's see how long this concept lasts.

## Beginner's Guide to Pulumi: Infrastructure as Code with Code

__Session Abstract__:
Pulumi is more than just, "A competitor to Terraform." It's an Infrastructure as Code tool for managing cloud infrastructure through general purpose coding languages like C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, and others. In this introductory session we'll review the basic features of Pulumi and review some code demos that show how easy it is to get started creating new cloud infrastructure. By then end of the session, we'll have enough of an understanding to get started using Pulumi to manage cloud infrastructure for any new projects.

## ConFoo 2024

ConFoo 2025 is a software conference held in Montreal Canada February 26-28, 2025. https://confoo.ca/en/2025/schedule

I performed two sessions, "Azure IaC for Developers with C# and Pulumi" and "Intro to OpenTelemetry for Developers".


## Azure IaC for Developers with C# and Pulumi

__Session Abstract__: 
As developers we know what our application needs from the cloud, so we should be the ones creating the cloud infrastructure for the app. Pulumi is an IaC tool that lets you use general purpose coding languages like C#, TypeScript, and others. So in this session we'll look at how to use C# and Pulumi together for writing Infrastructure as Code to create Azure services and then deploy our apps to it.

## Intro to OpenTelemetry for Developers

__Session Abstract__: 
OpenTelemetry (OTel) is a vendor-neutral, open standard for observing distributed applications. With OTel, you can trace individual requests and view specific metrics about the system's current state. It's like a superset of traditional logging and can be used with or instead of log statements. In this session, we'll review the basics of OpenTelemetry, discuss why you should consider using it, and see a demo of using it across backend services.

## Updating Dependencies

Be honest, when was the last time you made sure all dependencies were updated? NuGets, NPMs, etc? It's bad for security (vulnerabilities become public knowledge, supply chain attacks), and it's bad for maintainability (more work when you do upgrade).

Shameless self promotion. I made a .NET Tool to update dependency packages (among other things). It's detailed <a href="/posts/20241103_CodeUpdater">here</a>.

Maybe in the new year we should all resolve to stay on top of updates.

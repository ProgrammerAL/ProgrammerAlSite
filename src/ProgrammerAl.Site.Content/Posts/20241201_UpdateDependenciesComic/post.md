## Updating Dependencies

Be honest, when was the last time you made sure all dependencies were updated? NuGets, NPMs, etc? It's bad for security (vulnerabilities become public knowledge, supply chain attacks), and it's bad for maintainability (more work when you do upgrade).

Shameless self promotion. I made a .NET Tool to update dependency packages (among other things). It's detailed [in an older post here](/posts/20241103_CodeUpdater).

I think we've all been in the above situation. Delaying an update to those dependencies because we know the current configuration "works". But that's just focusing on the feature. The feature works, but security and maintainability might already be broken and we don't even attempt to test it. Maybe in the new year we should all resolve to stay on top of updates. Hint hint, wink wink.

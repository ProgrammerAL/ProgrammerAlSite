## DevOps Days Tampa Bay 2024

DevOps Days Tampa Bay 2024 was hosted on September 19, 2024. https://devopsdays.org/events/2024-tampa/welcome/

I performed a 5-minute lightning talk session titled "Doing DevOps like a Dev" which was a talk to convince others to automate more, as a developer would do.

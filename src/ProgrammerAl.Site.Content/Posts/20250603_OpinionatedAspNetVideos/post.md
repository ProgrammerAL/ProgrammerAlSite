## A Very Opinionated ASP.NET Youtube Series

We all have our standard ways of setting up and architecting ASP.NET Core applications. I decided to make some videos showing off certain design choices I like to make, along with the Pros and Cons of each of those descisions. 

At the time of this writing, not all videos have been created. I'm not yet sure how many there will be, but the final video will be some sort of summary/closing thoughts.

The first video is initial setup, and to be honest, not really worth a watch. But I was doing the work to set it up anyway, so it's an extra video for free.

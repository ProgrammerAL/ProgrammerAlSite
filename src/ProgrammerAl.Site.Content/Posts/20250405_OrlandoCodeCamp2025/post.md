__Session Abstract__: 
Writing code is only ~40% of software development work. Maintaining high-quality code is maybe another ~20%. Reviewing PRs and updating dependencies are just some of the manual processes we have to deal with that regularly take us away from the fun part of software development: writing code.

Did you know a C# project can tell you when there's a known security vulnerability for a NuGet package it's using? How about using a file to manage warnings/errors/suggestions for the entire project? You can even commit the file to source control, so no one needs a 3rd party extension to manage those settings. (That's the .editorconfig file by the way. It's really cool.)

In this session, we'll look at features like those above (and more!) that we can enable within our codebases to set us up for future success. And best of all, you can enable all of these features for free. So you can enable them whenever you're ready.
